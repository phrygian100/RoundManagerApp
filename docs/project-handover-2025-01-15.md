# RoundManagerApp - Project Handover
**Date:** January 15, 2025  
**Status:** Production Ready  
**Latest Critical Fix:** Round Order Logic & Mobile Picker Issues Resolved

---

## 🚨 LATEST CRITICAL UPDATE - JUST RESOLVED ✅

### Round Order Logic & Mobile Picker Issues - FULLY RESOLVED
**Date Completed:** January 15, 2025

#### Critical Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: Round order manager allowed duplicate round order numbers (e.g., two clients with round order 24)
- **Root Cause**: Flawed insertion logic that didn't properly shift existing clients when inserting at a position
- **Impact**: Broke the fundamental assumption that round order numbers should be continuous (1, 2, 3, 4, ...)

#### Solution Implemented - Complete Logic Rewrite
**Three Operation Types Now Working Correctly:**

1. **INSERT Mode** (new/restored client): Increment all clients at/after selected position by +1
2. **MOVE Mode** (edit existing): Shift clients between old and new positions appropriately  
3. **ARCHIVE Mode** (remove client): Decrement all clients after removed position by -1

#### Round Order Integrity Rules Enforced
- **No Duplicates**: Each client has unique round order number
- **No Gaps**: Sequence is continuous (1, 2, 3, 4, ...)
- **Auto-Shift**: All affected clients automatically adjust when positions change
- **Archive-Safe**: Removing clients properly shifts remaining clients down
- **Restore-Safe**: Ex-clients restoration goes through proper round order manager

#### Mobile Picker Issues Also Fixed
- **Replaced Custom FlatList**: Switched from problematic manual scroll calculations to professional wheel picker package
- **Package Used**: `@quidone/react-native-wheel-picker@1.4.1` (Expo compatible, 170+ GitHub stars)
- **Result**: Zero sync issues, smooth wheel picker scrolling

#### Files Modified
- `app/round-order-manager.tsx`: Complete handleConfirm logic rewrite + wheel picker implementation
- `app/(tabs)/clients/[id].tsx`: Improved archiving logic with targeted round order updates
- `package.json`: Added wheel picker dependency

## 👥 TEAM STRUCTURE & PERMISSIONS

### Permission System
- **Owner Role**: Full access to all features
- **Member Role**: Limited access based on assigned permissions
- **Permission Gates**: Component-based access control throughout app

### Current Permission Types
```typescript
{
  viewClients: boolean,      // Client list access
  editClients: boolean,      // Client modification
  viewRunsheet: boolean,     // Runsheet access
  viewAccounts: boolean,     // Financial data access
  manageTeam: boolean,       // Team management
  manageVehicles: boolean    // Vehicle assignments
}
```

### User Management Flow
1. **Owner Registration**: Creates account and becomes primary owner
2. **Member Invitation**: Owner sends invite codes to team members  
3. **Permission Assignment**: Owner configures role-based access
4. **JWT Claims**: Authentication tokens contain role and permission data
