### Job Deferral/Move Tracking - Original Date Preservation

**Problem**: When a user moved/deferred a job from one week to another, the system lost track of the original scheduled date. This caused:
1. Confusion in the `/clients` page where "Next Visit" didn't indicate the job had been moved
2. Potential duplicate job generation when the job generation dedup logic only checked `scheduledTime` (the moved-to date), not the original date
3. No visibility into which jobs in the Service Schedule were moved

**Solution**: Added `originalScheduledTime` field tracking and display throughout the system.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Data Model (`types/models.ts`)
- Added `originalScheduledTime?: string` field to the `Job` type
- This field stores the original date before a job was moved/deferred

#### 2. Defer/Move Logic (`app/runsheet/[week].tsx`)
- Updated `handleDeferToNextWeek()` to store `originalScheduledTime` when deferring a job
- Updated `handleDeferDateChange()` to store `originalScheduledTime` when moving a job to a custom date
- Logic preserves the FIRST original date if a job is moved multiple times

#### 3. Job Generation Dedup (`services/jobService.ts`)
- Updated dedup logic in `createJobsForClient()` (both service plan and legacy paths)
- Updated dedup logic in `createJobsForWeek()`
- Updated dedup logic in `createJobsForServicePlan()`
- Updated dedup logic in `createJobsForAdditionalServices()`
- Now checks BOTH `scheduledTime` AND `originalScheduledTime` to prevent duplicate job creation when a job has been moved
- **Important**: Moving a job does NOT change the service plan's anchor date - recurrence continues from the original schedule

#### 4. Client Detail Page (`app/(tabs)/clients/[id].tsx`)
- Added `originalScheduledVisit` state to track the original date
- Updated `fetchNextScheduledVisit()` to also fetch `originalScheduledTime` from the next pending job
- Updated "Next Service" / "Next Scheduled Visit" display (both desktop and mobile layouts) to show:
  - `"06 December 2025 (moved from 15 December 2025)"` if job was moved
  - Normal date display if job was not moved
- **Service Schedule list**: Added orange "(moved from [date])" indicator for moved jobs

#### 5. Clients List Page (`app/clients.tsx`)
- Added `originalVisits` state to track original dates per client
- Updated `fetchNextVisits()` to also capture `originalScheduledTime` for each client's next job
- Updated renderItem to display:
  - `"6 Dec 2025 (moved from 15 Dec)"` format if job was moved
  - Normal date display if job was not moved

### User-Facing Behavior:
- When viewing the clients list or client detail page, if a job has been moved/deferred, users will see:
  - The ACTUAL scheduled date (when the job will occur)
  - Plus "(moved from [original date])" to show where it was originally scheduled
  - OR just "(moved)" for jobs moved before this tracking was added
- The Service Schedule list now highlights moved jobs with an orange indicator
- Job generation will no longer create duplicate jobs for the original date when a job has been moved
- **Recurrence is NOT affected**: Moving a job is an exception - the service plan anchor date (editable only in Manage Services) controls future job generation

### Follow-up Fix (Same Day):
- **Display format corrected**: Shows "ORIGINAL DATE (moved to NEW DATE)" - displaying when it SHOULD have been per the schedule, then where it was moved to
- **Added fallback for legacy moved jobs**: Jobs moved before this code was deployed only have `isDeferred: true` flag but no `originalScheduledTime`. These show "(Moved)" indicator without the original date.
- **Service Schedule list**: Shows "(Moved from 15th Dec)" in orange for jobs with original date tracked, or just "(Moved)" for legacy jobs
- **Applied to all locations**: Service Details, Next Scheduled Visit, Service Schedule list, and Clients list page

**Note**: For jobs moved BEFORE this tracking was added, the original date cannot be shown because it wasn't stored. The service plan's startDate (anchor) must be manually corrected in Manage Services to fix recurrence.

### Added Active Clients Count Display with Info Modal
- **Location**: `app/clients.tsx`
- **Features**: 
  - Added "Active: X clients" count below the total clients count
  - Added blue info icon (ⓘ) next to the Active count
  - Tapping the icon opens an informational modal
- **Logic**: Counts only clients with valid future service dates (nextVisit >= now)
- **Excludes**: Clients with null, "N/A", or past nextVisit dates
- **Modal Content**: Explains that this shows clients who have future services scheduled

### Client Status Issue Investigation
- **Issue**: User suspected ex-clients were being included in the total client count
- **Root Cause**: The client filter in `app/clients.tsx` uses `client.status !== 'ex-client'` which includes:
  - Clients with `status = 'active'` ✅
  - Clients with `status = undefined` or `null` (legacy data) ⚠️
  - Clients with any other unexpected status value ⚠️

- **Problem**: Some clients may not have a status field (legacy data from before the field was introduced), causing them to be counted as active even if they should be ex-clients.

- **Created Diagnostic Tools**:
  1. `scripts/check-client-status.js` - Analyzes all clients and categorizes them by status
  2. `scripts/fix-client-status.js` - Interactive tool to fix clients with missing/invalid status

### How to Run the Diagnostic Scripts

**Note**: The scripts now have the Firebase configuration hardcoded from app.config.ts so they can connect directly.

1. **Check for problematic clients**:
```powershell
node scripts/check-client-status.js <your-email> <your-password>
```

2. **Fix clients with missing status**:
```powershell
node scripts/fix-client-status.js <your-email> <your-password>
```

Replace `<your-email>` and `<your-password>` with your actual Firebase login credentials.

### Recommendation
If the diagnostic script finds clients without a status field:
1. These are being counted in the "Total: X Clients" number
2. Run the fix script to set them to either "active" or "ex-client" 
3. Clients with round order numbers are likely active
4. Clients without round order numbers might be ex-clients that were archived before proper status tracking
