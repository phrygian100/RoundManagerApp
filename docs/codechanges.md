### Job Deferral/Move Tracking - Original Date Preservation

**Problem**: When a user moved/deferred a job from one week to another, the system lost track of the original scheduled date. This caused:
1. Confusion in the `/clients` page where "Next Visit" showed the moved-to date instead of the original
2. Potential duplicate job generation when the job generation dedup logic only checked `scheduledTime` (the moved-to date), not the original date

**Solution**: Added `originalScheduledTime` field tracking and display throughout the system.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Data Model (`types/models.ts`)
- Added `originalScheduledTime?: string` field to the `Job` type
- This field stores the original date before a job was moved/deferred

#### 2. Defer/Move Logic (`app/runsheet/[week].tsx`)
- Updated `handleDeferToNextWeek()` to store `originalScheduledTime` when deferring a job
- Updated `handleDeferDateChange()` to store `originalScheduledTime` when moving a job to a custom date
- Logic preserves the FIRST original date if a job is moved multiple times

#### 3. Job Generation Dedup (`services/jobService.ts`)
- Updated dedup logic in `createJobsForClient()` (both service plan and legacy paths)
- Updated dedup logic in `createJobsForWeek()`
- Updated dedup logic in `createJobsForServicePlan()`
- Updated dedup logic in `createJobsForAdditionalServices()`
- Now checks BOTH `scheduledTime` AND `originalScheduledTime` to prevent duplicate job creation when a job has been moved

#### 4. Client Detail Page (`app/(tabs)/clients/[id].tsx`)
- Added `originalScheduledVisit` state to track the original date
- Updated `fetchNextScheduledVisit()` to also fetch `originalScheduledTime` from the next pending job
- Updated "Next Service" display (both desktop and mobile layouts) to show:
  - `"02 December 2024 (moved to 09 December 2024)"` if job was moved
  - Normal date display if job was not moved

#### 5. Clients List Page (`app/clients.tsx`)
- Added `originalVisits` state to track original dates per client
- Updated `fetchNextVisits()` to also capture `originalScheduledTime` for each client's next job
- Updated renderItem to display:
  - `"2 Dec (moved to 9 Dec 2024)"` format if job was moved
  - Normal date display if job was not moved

### User-Facing Behavior:
- When viewing the clients list or client detail page, if a job has been moved/deferred, users will see:
  - The original scheduled date
  - Plus "(moved to [new date])"
- This provides clear visibility into both when the job was originally scheduled and when it will actually occur
- Job generation will no longer create duplicate jobs for the original date when a job has been moved

### Added Active Clients Count Display with Info Modal
- **Location**: `app/clients.tsx`
- **Features**: 
  - Added "Active: X clients" count below the total clients count
  - Added blue info icon (ⓘ) next to the Active count
  - Tapping the icon opens an informational modal
- **Logic**: Counts only clients with valid future service dates (nextVisit >= now)
- **Excludes**: Clients with null, "N/A", or past nextVisit dates
- **Modal Content**: Explains that this shows clients who have future services scheduled

### Client Status Issue Investigation
- **Issue**: User suspected ex-clients were being included in the total client count
- **Root Cause**: The client filter in `app/clients.tsx` uses `client.status !== 'ex-client'` which includes:
  - Clients with `status = 'active'` ✅
  - Clients with `status = undefined` or `null` (legacy data) ⚠️
  - Clients with any other unexpected status value ⚠️

- **Problem**: Some clients may not have a status field (legacy data from before the field was introduced), causing them to be counted as active even if they should be ex-clients.

- **Created Diagnostic Tools**:
  1. `scripts/check-client-status.js` - Analyzes all clients and categorizes them by status
  2. `scripts/fix-client-status.js` - Interactive tool to fix clients with missing/invalid status

### How to Run the Diagnostic Scripts

**Note**: The scripts now have the Firebase configuration hardcoded from app.config.ts so they can connect directly.

1. **Check for problematic clients**:
```powershell
node scripts/check-client-status.js <your-email> <your-password>
```

2. **Fix clients with missing status**:
```powershell
node scripts/fix-client-status.js <your-email> <your-password>
```

Replace `<your-email>` and `<your-password>` with your actual Firebase login credentials.

### Recommendation
If the diagnostic script finds clients without a status field:
1. These are being counted in the "Total: X Clients" number
2. Run the fix script to set them to either "active" or "ex-client" 
3. Clients with round order numbers are likely active
4. Clients without round order numbers might be ex-clients that were archived before proper status tracking
