## 2025-01-23

- Fixed Job Movement Between Vehicles (400 Error Resolution)
  - File: `app/runsheet/[week].tsx`
  - Fixed 400 bad request error when moving jobs between vehicles
  - Properly handle vehicleId field deletion using `deleteField()` from Firebase
  - Simplified handleDeferDateChange function to avoid complex state management issues
  - Added proper error handling with try-catch block
  - Added console logging for debugging database updates
  - Fixed local state update to properly handle vehicleId removal

- Manual Organization Mode for Runsheets
  - File: `app/runsheet/[week].tsx`
  - Fixed issue where moving jobs between vehicles would trigger automatic redistribution, causing unwanted job movements
  - Added `manualOrganizationMode` state and `preservedAllocations` state to control and preserve job allocations
  - Modified `allocateJobsForDay` function to accept `preserveExistingAllocations` and `dateKey` parameters
  - When toggling TO manual mode:
    - Current vehicle allocations are captured and preserved
    - Jobs remain in their current vehicles without redistribution
    - No "Unallocated" section is created - jobs stay where they were
  - When in manual mode:
    - Jobs maintain their positions from when manual mode was activated
    - Manual vehicle assignments are respected
    - Vehicles can exceed capacity without triggering redistribution
    - New manual assignments update the preserved allocations
  - Added toggle button in runsheet header (‚öôÔ∏è/üîí icon) to switch between modes:
    - ‚öôÔ∏è = Auto-allocation mode (default behavior)
    - üîí = Manual organization mode (preserves current allocations)
  - Manual mode automatically activates when user assigns a job to a specific vehicle
  - Visual indicator (orange background) shows when manual mode is active
  - Switching back to auto mode clears preserved allocations and re-enables automatic distribution

- Defer Feature Implementation
  - Files: `types/models.ts`, `app/runsheet/[week].tsx`, `services/capacityService.ts`
  - Added `isDeferred` field to Job type model to track jobs that have been rolled over from previous weeks
  - Implemented "Defer" button in job action sheets (iOS ActionSheet and Android/Web Modal) - only visible for non-completed jobs
  - Created `handleDeferToNextWeek` function that:
    - Moves job to Monday of following week at 09:00
    - Sets `isDeferred: true` flag
    - Clears manual vehicle assignment and ETA
    - Triggers capacity redistribution for the target week
  - Updated sorting logic to prioritize deferred jobs:
    - In capacity redistribution (`capacityService.ts`): deferred jobs placed first before regular jobs
    - In runsheet display: deferred jobs appear first within each vehicle's allocation
  - Added visual distinction for deferred jobs:
    - Red background (#ffe6e6) with red border
    - Red address block header (#d32f2f)
    - "ROLLOVER" label badge in red (#ff5252)
  - Integration with existing capacity system ensures deferred jobs automatically cascade other jobs when capacity limits are exceeded
  - Deferred jobs behave as normal jobs after initial placement (can be moved, completed, or deferred again)

- 2025-08-18: Payments CSV import fix
  - Normalized client account numbers when building the account map in `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx` for both web and mobile flows (trim, ensure `RWC` prefix, uppercase).
  - This resolves failures when importing rows (notably 'cash' payments) due to mismatches caused by stored account numbers lacking the `RWC` prefix or containing whitespace/case differences.
  - Also fixed a Firestore write error by removing undefined fields: importer now only includes `notes` when non-empty, and `createPayment()` strips undefined values before writing.

## 2025-08-19

- Home screen responsive improvements (desktop widescreen)
  - File: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
  - Added aspect-ratio + width detection using `useWindowDimensions()` to better distinguish desktop-like web views from mobile. Treats views as desktop when width ‚â• 1024 and aspect ratio ‚â• 1.6.
  - Increased buttons per row to 4 on desktop-like web; 3 for other web; 2 for native.
  - Center-constrained each row on web and reduced tile max width on widescreen (200px) to prevent oversized tiles and overlap; rows compute exact max width from tile width + gaps.
  - Removed direct import of `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`; now reads `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` env var with safe fallback, resolving a linter error and aligning with current config approach.

- Marketing site mobile sizing cleanup
  - Files: `web/src/app/home/page.tsx`, `web/src/app/feature-tour/page.tsx`, `web/src/app/pricing/page.tsx`, `web/src/app/about/page.tsx`, `web/src/app/contact/page.tsx`, `web/src/app/privacy-policy/page.tsx`, `web/src/app/terms/page.tsx`, `app/login.tsx`
  - Adjusted nav logo sizing to `h-10 sm:h-12 md:h-16` across marketing pages for consistent scaling.
  - Tightened hero paddings and scaled headings/buttons with responsive Tailwind classes (`text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-6xl`, smaller button text/padding on mobile).
  - Lowered section paddings from `py-16` to `py-12` on mobile to reduce vertical whitespace.
  - Adjusted login screen (Expo web) with width-aware styles: nav logo 260√ó70 (desktop) / 220√ó60 (narrow web), card logo 240√ó96 (desktop) / 180√ó72 (narrow web), footer uses inverted logo at 180√ó56 (desktop) / 144√ó48 (narrow web).
  - Update: Increased all logo sizes ~2√ó after review
    - RN Web login: nav 520√ó140 desktop / 440√ó120 narrow web; card 480√ó192 desktop / 360√ó144 narrow web; footer 360√ó112 desktop / 288√ó96 narrow web.
    - Marketing pages: nav logo heights `h-20 sm:h-24 md:h-32`.

- Introduced service plan separation (no runtime behavior change yet; generation remains legacy until flag is enabled).
  - Added `types/servicePlan.ts` defining `ServicePlan` with `scheduleType`, `frequencyWeeks`, `startDate` (next future anchor), `lastServiceDate`, `price`, `isActive`.
  - Added `services/servicePlanService.ts` with helpers:
    - `createServicePlan`, `getServicePlansForClient`, `getNextFutureAnchor` (rolls to next future date), `deactivatePlanIfPastLastService`.
  - Added read-only migration audit: `scripts/audit-service-plans-migration.ts` to compute candidate anchors per client/service from pending jobs or rolled seeds.
  - Updated `services/jobService.ts` `createJobsForClient` to support plan-based generation (dedup, respects `lastServiceDate`), gated by `shared/features.ts` flag `USE_SERVICE_PLANS_GENERATION` (currently false).
  - No existing jobs modified; plan-based generator starts from the next future occurrence to preserve current planning.
  - Added `app/(tabs)/clients/[id]/manage-services.tsx` screen to view and edit service plans (frequency, next anchor, price, last service date, active), and linked from client details with a "Manage Services" button. Compatible with web and mobile date inputs.
  - Added scripts:
    - `scripts/audit-service-plans-migration.js` (read-only audit)
    - `scripts/migrate-service-plans.js` (idempotent write migration to create plans)

## 2025-08-23

- Fix client account number allocation to use highest existing + 1
  - Files: `services/clientService.ts`, `app/add-client.tsx`, `app/runsheet/[week].tsx`
  - Added `getNextAccountNumber()` helper that scans current owner's clients, parses both numeric and `RWC###` formats, and returns max + 1.
  - `AddClient` now uses this helper instead of ordering by `accountNumber`, avoiding lexicographic sorting issues and duplicate reuse like `RWC100`.
  - Quote-to-client creation path in runsheet now assigns `accountNumber: RWC<next>` so all new clients receive a unique number consistently.
  - CSV import paths already compute next numbers independently and were left unchanged.

- Edit Customer: account number editing reliability and validation
  - File: `app/(tabs)/clients/[id]/edit-customer.tsx`
  - Added cross-platform alert helper to show messages on web (previously some Alerts were invisible on web).
  - Normalizes entered account numbers to `RWC###` format and blocks duplicates for the current owner before saving.
  - Keeps all other behavior unchanged; no impact on mobile.
  - Relaxed legacy frequency validation: accepts numeric values (>0) or 'one-off'; otherwise skips updating frequency so unrelated edits (like account number) aren't blocked.

## 2025-08-14

- Implemented draft persistence for first-time setup to prevent data loss if the screen remounts shortly after login.
  - File: `components/FirstTimeSetupModal.tsx`
  - Added `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` usage to save and restore form state per user (`firstTimeSetupDraft:<uid>`).
  - Draft auto-loads when the modal becomes visible and auto-saves on field changes; cleared upon successful completion.
  - No changes to web-specific code paths; compatible with both mobile and web.

- Payments list: Added method filters and sorting controls.
  - File: `app/payments-list.tsx`
  - New method filter chips for Cash, Direct Debit, and BACS (bank transfer). Multiple can be toggled; when any are active, list filters accordingly.
  - New sort chips for Date and Amount; both sort descending (newest/largest first). Sorting applied after filtering and search.
  - UI integrates with existing search input; works on web and mobile without breaking layouts.

- Client list: Added sorting by weekly interval.
  - File: `app/clients.tsx`
  - New sort option key `weeklyInterval` included in the cycle list and label mapping.
  - Comparator reads `client.frequency` (number or string) and falls back to the smallest active `additionalServices.frequency` when primary is missing; clients without intervals sort last.
  - Preserves existing sort options and search/filter behavior for both mobile and web.

- Debounced auth redirect to login to prevent late redirect glitches during brief token refresh.
  - File: `app/_layout.tsx`
  - Increased debounce window to 5s to cover slower token/claims refreshes after login; still cleared once authenticated.

- Runsheet: Allow completing any job on the current day (per vehicle), track completion order per vehicle, and on day-complete show swap proposals for out-of-order completions. Quotes excluded. Confirming applies round-order swaps; closing skips. Clear completion tracking after day completion. Future-day jobs remain non-completable.

- Runsheet vehicle headers: Restore +/- toggle visibility for single-vehicle days
  - File: `app/runsheet/[week].tsx`
  - Change: Always render the vehicle collapse/expand `Pressable` with `+/-` instead of hiding it when there is only one vehicle in the day. Previously it was gated behind a `shouldShowCollapseButton` condition requiring 2+ vehicles, which caused the +/- to disappear on single-vehicle days.
  - Behavior: Users can collapse/expand the job list for a vehicle regardless of how many vehicles exist for that day. Web and mobile unaffected otherwise.

- Day Complete Summary modal: show loading state for direct-debit lookup
  - File: `app/runsheet/[week].tsx`
  - Changed conditional rendering so that while `summaryProcessing` is true, the modal displays "Looking up direct-debit jobs‚Ä¶" and does not prematurely show "No direct-debit jobs today." This prevents confusing flicker before GoCardless/job detection completes.
### (Date: 2025-08-03) ‚Äì Dynamic Sign-off in ETA Messages

1. `app/runsheet/[week].tsx`
   ‚Ä¢ Added `getUserProfile` import, `userProfile` state, and fetch logic.
   ‚Ä¢ Introduced dynamic `signOff` built from profile name, business name, and website.
   ‚Ä¢ Templates now reference `${signOff}` instead of hard-coded lines.

---

### (Date: 2025-08-03) ‚Äì Added Business Website field to Bank & Business Info Modal

1. `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`
   ‚Ä¢ Added `businessWebsite` field to bank info form state, load and save functions, and modal UI.
   
2. `types/models.ts`
   ‚Ä¢ Added `businessWebsite` optional string property to `User` type.

---

### (Date: 2025-07-31) ‚Äì Fix Feature Tour page not showing in production

1. `vercel.json`
   ‚Ä¢ Added rewrite rule mapping `/feature-tour` to `/_marketing/feature-tour/index.html` so the Feature Tour marketing page loads correctly on https://www.guvnor.app/feature-tour.

2. `scripts/merge-builds.js`
   ‚Ä¢ Added `'feature-tour'` to the list of routes validated after the marketing build is merged to ensure the page is present.



### (Date: 2025-01-17) ‚Äì Added Feature Tour Marketing Page

1. `web/src/app/feature-tour/page.tsx`
   ‚Ä¢ Created comprehensive Feature Tour page showcasing all Guvnor features
   ‚Ä¢ Features listed: Quoting, Smart Round Order Manager, Automated ETA messaging, GoCardless Integration, Smart planning, Team members, Solutions for not paying customers
   ‚Ä¢ Implemented responsive design with feature cards and professional styling
   ‚Ä¢ Added call-to-action sections linking to sign-up and pricing pages
   ‚Ä¢ Follows same design pattern as existing marketing pages

2. Navigation Updates (all web pages)
   ‚Ä¢ Updated navigation menus to include "Features" link pointing to `/feature-tour`
   ‚Ä¢ Modified pages: `web/src/app/pricing/page.tsx`, `web/src/app/about/page.tsx`, `web/src/app/contact/page.tsx`, `web/src/app/home/page.tsx`
   ‚Ä¢ Updated footer links in all pages to point to feature tour instead of home page
   ‚Ä¢ Consistent navigation order: Home, Features, Pricing, About, Contact, Sign In

### (Date: 2025-07-30) ‚Äì Added Payments CSV Export

1. `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`
   ‚Ä¢ Implemented `handleExportPayments` exporting all payments (columns: Account Number, Date, Amount (¬£), Type, Notes).
   ‚Ä¢ Added "Export Payments" button under Export Data.
   ‚Ä¢ Uses same share/download pattern as other exports.

### (Date: 2025-07-30) ‚Äì Runsheet ‚ÄúComplete Day‚Äù owner restriction & UX cleanup

1. `app/runsheet/[week].tsx`
   ‚Ä¢ Added owner detection (`getUserSession`) and `isOwner` state.
   ‚Ä¢ "Day complete?" button is now shown only for owners.
   ‚Ä¢ `handleDayComplete` blocks non-owner attempts with a permission alert.
   ‚Ä¢ Removed the modal prompt after the final job completes by disabling the `Alert` in `handleComplete`.
   ‚Ä¢ Updated session import to include `getUserSession`.

### (Date: 2025-07-31) ‚Äì Fixed Stripe Premium Upgrade Flow

1. `functions/index.js`
   ‚Ä¢ Added `defineSecret` import from `firebase-functions/params`
   ‚Ä¢ Declared `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` secrets
   ‚Ä¢ Bound secrets to functions: `createCheckoutSession`, `stripeWebhook`, `createCustomerPortalSession`
   ‚Ä¢ Functions now use `SECRET.value()` with env-var fallback for local emulation
   ‚Ä¢ Commented out conflicting `invoice_creation` config in subscription mode
   ‚Ä¢ Added CORS and public invoker configuration to stripeWebhook (lines 794-798)

2. `functions/package.json`
   ‚Ä¢ Pinned `firebase-functions` to `4.9.0` to ensure v2 function compatibility

3. **Manual Configuration Required**
   ‚Ä¢ The stripeWebhook function needs public access for Stripe to call it
   ‚Ä¢ Since gcloud CLI is not available locally, use Google Cloud Console:
     1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
     2. Select project: roundmanagerapp
     3. Navigate to Cloud Run
     4. Find service: "stripeWebhook"
     5. Click service name ‚Üí Permissions tab ‚Üí Add principal
     6. Enter "allUsers" as principal, select "Cloud Run Invoker" role
     7. Click Save
   ‚Ä¢ This allows Stripe webhooks to invoke the function without authentication

### (Date: 2025-01-19) ‚Äì CSV Import Auto-Assignment for Account Numbers and Round Orders

1. `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`
   ‚Ä¢ Removed "Account Number" and "Round Order" from `requiredFields` array - blank values no longer cause import failures
   ‚Ä¢ Added auto-generation logic for missing account numbers:
     - Scans existing clients and CSV rows to find highest RWC number
     - Assigns sequential RWC### values to blank entries
     - Prevents duplicates by maintaining a Set of used numbers
   ‚Ä¢ Added auto-generation logic for missing round order numbers:
     - Finds highest existing round order from clients and CSV
     - Assigns sequential integers (1, 2, 3...) to blank entries
     - Tracks usage to avoid conflicts
   ‚Ä¢ Enhanced success messages to show auto-assignment counts:
     - "Auto-assigned account numbers: N." when N > 0
     - "Auto-assigned round order numbers: N." when N > 0
   ‚Ä¢ Applied consistent logic across all import paths:
     - Web CSV import
     - Mobile CSV import  
     - Mobile Excel (.xlsx/.xls) import

**Impact:** Users can now import client CSVs with blank account numbers and/or round orders. The system automatically assigns unique, sequential values while preserving any existing numbers specified in the CSV. This eliminates the need to manually fill these columns before import.

### (Date: 2025-07-31) ‚Äì Added Subscription Renewal Date Display

1. `functions/index.js`
   ‚Ä¢ Updated `updateUserSubscription` helper to accept and store `renewalDate` parameter
   ‚Ä¢ Modified subscription webhook handlers to extract `current_period_end` from Stripe events
   ‚Ä¢ Convert Stripe timestamp to ISO string and store as `subscriptionRenewalDate` in Firestore

2. `services/subscriptionService.ts`
   ‚Ä¢ Added `renewalDate` field to `EffectiveSubscription` interface
   ‚Ä¢ Updated `getEffectiveSubscription` function to return renewal date from user data
   ‚Ä¢ Added renewal date to all return statements (including fallbacks)

3. `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`
   ‚Ä¢ Added renewal date display for premium subscriptions in subscription card
   ‚Ä¢ Shows date in format: "Next renewal: 15 August 2025"
   ‚Ä¢ Added `subscriptionRenewal` style for formatting
   ‚Ä¢ Only displays for premium tier when renewal date is available

---

### (Date: 2025-08-12) ‚Äì Stabilize Android EAS Build

1. `package.json`
   ‚Ä¢ Removed `@supabase/supabase-js`, `crypto-browserify`, `stream-browserify`, `firebase-functions`, `gocardless`, and `stripe` from app dependencies to eliminate Node/server-only modules and Supabase usage per project rules.
   ‚Ä¢ These packages are either unused in the client app or belong on the server (Cloud Functions already use their own `functions/package.json`).

2. `app.json`
   ‚Ä¢ Set `newArchEnabled` to `false` to avoid New Architecture incompatibilities on Android for SDK 53 + current native modules.

3. `metro.config.js`
   ‚Ä¢ Removed Node polyfill injection and kept Metro near defaults; this prevents brittle module resolution on EAS Android.

Rationale:
‚Ä¢ Previous build issues were caused by version/config mismatches and Node polyfills introduced to support Supabase/Node libs. Supabase is no longer used. Removing those and disabling New Arch stabilizes Android bundling without impacting web or iOS.

Impact:
‚Ä¢ Expo start/bundle should succeed locally; Android EAS builds should progress past JS bundling phase. Cloud Functions continue to use Stripe in `functions/` where appropriate.

Dev workflow note:
‚Ä¢ Added `cross-env`-backed start scripts (`start`, `start:clean`, `android`, `android:clean`) to enforce classic bundling and static router imports during local dev to avoid Metro serializer errors on Android.

Follow-up:
‚Ä¢ Pinned `@expo/metro-config` to 0.20.12 to pick up fixes in Expo‚Äôs serializer fork that impact `getModuleParams`/chunk path computation. For EAS, we no longer override the serializer in `metro.config.js` to ensure the format expected by the CLI (removed experimental serializer options and gating the override behind `METRO_UPSTREAM_SERIALIZER=1` for local only).

### (Date: 2025-08-12) ‚Äì Firebase Config Fallback + Remove Legacy Env File

1. `core/firebase.ts`
   ‚Ä¢ Reads Firebase config in this order now: `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` env vars ‚Üí `Constants.expoConfig.extra.firebase` (from `app.config.ts`/`app.json`) ‚Üí `FIREBASE_CONFIG` from `config.ts`.
   ‚Ä¢ Prevents dev crashes when `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` vars aren‚Äôt set locally.

2. Repo hygiene
‚Ä¢ Removed `ServiceKey.env.local` (contained legacy Supabase service role key). Supabase is no longer used.
‚Ä¢ Recommendation: keep this filename in `.gitignore` going forward; rotate the exposed key if it was real.

---

### (Date: 2025-08-13) ‚Äì Fix Android release crash-on-launch

1. `app.json`
   ‚Ä¢ Set `newArchEnabled` back to `false` for release builds to avoid native crash at startup observed on the internal APK. Reanimated Babel plugin remains enabled for release.

Context:
‚Ä¢ Dev client ran, but standalone APK crashed immediately on some devices. Disabling New Architecture stabilizes the release binary without affecting web.

---

### (Date: 2025-08-13) ‚Äì Add release-apk EAS profile

1. `eas.json`
   ‚Ä¢ Added `release-apk` profile to produce a standalone installable APK with conservative bundling and Firebase env baked in.
   ‚Ä¢ Use: `npx eas build --platform android --profile release-apk --non-interactive`.

---

### (Date: 2025-08-14) ‚Äì Fix Android crash: initialize Firebase Auth on RN

1. `core/firebase.ts`
   ‚Ä¢ Call `initializeAuth(app)` on native before `getAuth(app)` so the `auth` component is registered (fixes "Component auth has not been registered yet").

---

### (Date: 2025-08-26) ‚Äì Fix service plan changes not reflecting in Client Details and Service Schedule

1. **Client Details page update** - `app/(tabs)/clients/[id].tsx`
   ‚Ä¢ Added fetching of service plans from `servicePlans` collection in `fetchClient` function
   ‚Ä¢ Added `servicePlans` state to track active service plans for the client
   ‚Ä¢ Replaced legacy frequency/quote display with proper service plan information in Service Details card
   ‚Ä¢ Now displays all active service plans with their type, frequency, price, and next service date
   ‚Ä¢ Falls back to legacy fields only if no service plans exist

2. **Manage Services page improvements** - `app/(tabs)/clients/[id]/manage-services.tsx`
   ‚Ä¢ Added visual confirmation when changes are saved (green toast notification)
   ‚Ä¢ Added field name tracking to show which field was saved in the confirmation message
   ‚Ä¢ Improved user feedback by showing "‚úì [Field] saved" message for 2 seconds after each update
   ‚Ä¢ When price changes, automatically updates all pending jobs for that service (except jobs with custom prices)
   ‚Ä¢ Added "Regenerate Schedule" button for each service plan to delete old jobs and create new ones with updated settings
   ‚Ä¢ All changes are saved immediately to Firestore using batch writes for consistency

3. **Job Service updates** - `services/jobService.ts`
   ‚Ä¢ Added `createJobsForServicePlan` function to generate jobs for a specific service plan
   ‚Ä¢ Handles proper date calculations, respects lastServiceDate, and avoids duplicates
   ‚Ä¢ Uses batch operations for efficient job creation

4. **Web platform compatibility fixes** - `app/(tabs)/clients/[id]/manage-services.tsx`
   ‚Ä¢ Fixed regenerate button not working on web platform
   ‚Ä¢ Replaced Alert.alert with window.confirm for web confirmation dialogs
   ‚Ä¢ Uses platform-specific alert methods (window.alert for web, Alert.alert for mobile)
   ‚Ä¢ Fixed import path for jobService module (needed extra ../ for correct path resolution)

5. **Permission issue fixes for regenerate schedule** - `app/(tabs)/clients/[id]/manage-services.tsx`
   ‚Ä¢ Changed from batch delete to individual delete operations for better permission handling
   ‚Ä¢ Added comprehensive error logging to help debug permission issues
   ‚Ä¢ Enhanced error messages to show specific error details to users
   ‚Ä¢ Added proper error handling for job creation failures
   ‚Ä¢ Continues deleting other jobs even if one fails due to permissions

6. **Firestore index optimization** - `services/jobService.ts`
   ‚Ä¢ Fixed "query requires an index" error in createJobsForServicePlan function
   ‚Ä¢ Simplified the job existence check query to use only ownerId and clientId where clauses
   ‚Ä¢ Moved service type and date filtering to in-memory operations to avoid composite index requirement
   ‚Ä¢ This eliminates the need to create additional Firestore indexes while maintaining functionality

7. **Extended job generation outlook to 1 year** - Multiple files
   ‚Ä¢ Changed default job generation period from 8 weeks to 52 weeks (1 full year)
   ‚Ä¢ Updated in `services/jobService.ts`: createJobsForClient, createJobsForServicePlan, createJobsForAdditionalServices
   ‚Ä¢ Updated in `app/(tabs)/clients/[id]/manage-services.tsx`: regenerate schedule now creates 1 year of jobs
   ‚Ä¢ Updated in `app/(tabs)/clients/[id].tsx`: adding additional services creates 1 year of jobs
   ‚Ä¢ Updated in `app/(tabs)/clients/[id]/edit-customer.tsx`: regenerating jobs creates 1 year outlook
   ‚Ä¢ Updated in `app/add-client.tsx`: new clients get 1 year of jobs generated
   ‚Ä¢ This ensures users can see their full year schedule at a glance

8. **Added delete button to Service Schedule jobs** - `app/(tabs)/clients/[id].tsx`
   ‚Ä¢ Added red X delete button to each job in the Service Schedule section
   ‚Ä¢ Implemented confirmation dialog before deletion (platform-specific: window.confirm for web, Alert.alert for mobile)
   ‚Ä¢ Deleting a job removes it from Firestore immediately
   ‚Ä¢ Updates local state to reflect deletion without page refresh
   ‚Ä¢ Jobs deleted here are also removed from runsheets as they share the same data source
   ‚Ä¢ Added proper error handling with user feedback if deletion fails

This ensures that changes made in the Manage Services page are immediately reflected in both the Client Details page and the Service Schedule, with prices automatically updating for pending jobs and the ability to regenerate the entire schedule when dates or frequency changes. All functionality now works correctly on both web and mobile platforms with improved error handling, no additional Firestore index requirements, a full year's outlook of scheduled jobs, and the ability to delete individual jobs directly from the Service Schedule.
