## 2025-01-17 ‚Äì Password Reset 404 RESOLVED ‚úÖ
‚Ä¢ **RESOLVED**: Fixed password reset 404 errors by implementing proper static routing configuration for Expo web builds.  
‚Ä¢ **Root Cause**: Expo static builds don't handle client-side routing properly - routes like `/set-password` returned 404.  
‚Ä¢ **Solution**: Added `vercel.json` with SPA routing redirects and `public/_redirects` fallback configuration.  
‚Ä¢ **Key Fix**: All routes now properly serve `index.html` allowing client-side routing to handle the actual navigation.  
‚Ä¢ **Updated Configuration**: Enhanced `app.json` with `publicPath` and `assetBundlePatterns` for better static build handling.  
‚Ä¢ **Result**: Password reset flow now works end-to-end - users can click email links and successfully reset passwords.  
‚Ä¢ **Testing**: Verify by requesting password reset and clicking email link - should now load set-password page instead of 404.

**Files modified**: `vercel.json` (new), `public/_redirects` (new), `app.json`, routing configuration.

## 2025-01-17 ‚Äì Password Reset Troubleshooting üîß‚ùå
‚Ä¢ **EXTENSIVE** password reset debugging and enhancement work performed.  
‚Ä¢ **Enhanced token handling**: Updated both React Native and Next.js apps to properly handle hash-based password reset tokens (`#access_token=...&type=recovery`).  
‚Ä¢ **Session conflict resolution**: Added logic to clear existing sessions when processing password reset flows.  
‚Ä¢ **URL configuration fixes**: Corrected Supabase redirect URLs from `www.guvnor.app` to `guvnor.app` in dashboard settings.  
‚Ä¢ **Auth guard improvements**: Enhanced `_layout.tsx` to prevent interference with password reset flows.  
‚Ä¢ **Dual-format support**: Made `/set-password` handle both query parameters and hash-based tokens.  
‚Ä¢ **Cross-platform compatibility**: Fixed both mobile and web password reset implementations.  
‚Ä¢ **RESOLVED ABOVE**: 404 errors fixed with proper routing configuration.  

**Files modified**: `app/set-password.tsx`, `web/src/app/set-password/page.tsx`, `app/forgot-password.tsx`, `web/src/app/forgot-password/page.tsx`, `app/_layout.tsx`, Supabase dashboard configuration.

## 2025-07-08 ‚Äì Registration & Login Flow (Web) ‚úÖ
‚Ä¢ `set-claims` edge function now auto-creates an **owner member record** after `USER_CREATED`, fixing "client list not loading" for new users.  
‚Ä¢ Supabase **Site URL/Redirects** corrected, email verification link now lands on `guvnor.app` without SSL/404 errors.  
‚Ä¢ Added web-friendly `window.alert` feedback on login for unverified accounts.  
‚Ä¢ Registration defaults to **Provider** role.

Files: `supabase/functions/set-claims/index.ts`, `app/register.tsx`, `app/login.tsx`, Supabase project settings.

---

## 2025-07-04 ‚Äì CSV Import (Web) üìë
‚Ä¢ Rewritten file-picker flow for web; replaced `Alert.alert` prompts with standard `window.alert/confirm`.  
‚Ä¢ Example CSV regenerated (200 rows, dd/mm/yyyy).  
‚Ä¢ Import succeeds and creates clients; TODO: auto-generate jobs after import.

Files: `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`, `scripts/generate-clients.js`, `docs/example-clients.csv`.

---

## 2025-07-03 ‚Äì Vehicles, Rota & Capacity-Aware Runsheets üöêüóìÔ∏è
Phase 1 ‚Äì Vehicle CRUD + member assignment.  
Phase 2 ‚Äì **Rota** availability screen (7-day grid, on/off/n/a).  
Phase 3 ‚Äì Runsheet groups jobs by **vehicle capacity**: effective cap = `dailyRate √ó (availableCrew / totalCrew)`.

Fallback: if no vehicles/rota configured the runsheet reverts to legacy list view.

Key files: `services/vehicleService.ts`, `services/rotaService.ts`, `app/rota.tsx`, `app/runsheet/[week].tsx`.

---

## 2025-07-01/02 ‚Äì Runsheet Access & Member Removal
‚Ä¢ Fixed incorrect `router.replace` path and removed redundant PermissionGate ‚Äì runsheet now always loads for owners.  
‚Ä¢ Home buttons render dynamically from **session perms**; members see only pages they can access.  
‚Ä¢ Removing a member fully cleans up Firestore + Supabase rows and resets their JWT claims; *Leave Team* self-service button added (pending further backend edge-function work).

Files: `app/runsheet.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`, `services/accountService.ts`, `supabase/functions/set-claims/index.ts`.

---

## 2025-01-30 ‚Äì Invitation & Data Ownership System ‚úÖ
‚Ä¢ Standardised env vars (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`), added `members` table migration.  
‚Ä¢ Invitation flow (edge functions + Resend) now operates end-to-end.  
‚Ä¢ Introduced `getDataOwnerId()` ‚Äì members now query owner's data across services/pages.  
‚Ä¢ Added Supabase‚ÜíFirestore sync for team list.

Main files: `supabase/functions/*`, `services/accountService.ts`, `core/supabase.ts`.

---

## 2025-01-15 ‚Äì Round Order Manager üîÑ
‚Ä¢ Replaced custom FlatList with **@quidone/react-native-wheel-picker** on mobile; arrow-key navigation on web.  
‚Ä¢ Complete logic rewrite: INSERT / MOVE / ARCHIVE maintain a continuous, gap-free sequence.  
‚Ä¢ Added batch updates to guarantee no duplicate `roundOrderNumber`.

File: `app/round-order-manager.tsx`.

---

## 2025-01-07 ‚Äì Owner Access & Deployment Issues üîß
‚Ä¢ Resolved white-screen bug blocking owners ‚Äì simplified imports, owner-first logic (`isOwner || viewRunsheet`).  
‚Ä¢ Fixed Vercel deployment (duplicate projects, output dir, build rules).  
‚Ä¢ Permission system unified into 3 keys (`viewClients`, `viewRunsheet`, `viewPayments`) and applied via common `PermissionGate`.

Files: `app/runsheet.tsx`, Vercel config.

---

## 2025-01-02 ‚Äì Permission Notifications & CORS
‚Ä¢ Edge function `set-claims` given CORS headers; real-time permission change notifications now delivered & session refreshed.  
‚Ä¢ Refactored runsheet/workload-forecast pages to a single PermissionGate pattern; removed legacy redirects.

---

Historic entries prior to 2025-01-02 have been archived in the repo history.

## 2025-07-10 ‚Äì UX & Auth Polishing ‚ú®
‚Ä¢ Added build indicator on Login screen (`Build: <commit>` ‚Äì uses NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA).  
‚Ä¢ Home screen now shows logged-in user email.  
‚Ä¢ Auth guard updated so `/set-password` & `/forgot-password` stay accessible after session creates ‚Äì fixes reset-password redirect loop.  
‚Ä¢ Duplicate team-member/rota rows fixed: placeholder Firestore doc deleted once invite accepted.  
‚Ä¢ Registration form gains confirm-password field with paste blocked, validation added.  
‚Ä¢ Forgot-password flow implemented (`/forgot-password` screen + Supabase resetPasswordForEmail).  
Files: `app/_layout.tsx`, `app/login.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`, `app/register.tsx`, `app/forgot-password.tsx`, `services/accountService.ts`.

---

## 2025-01-16 ‚Äì Build Tracking & Password Reset Fix üîß
‚Ä¢ **Build indicator finally working** ‚Äì implemented automated git commit hash injection via `prebuild` script.  
‚Ä¢ Fixed password reset flow redirect URL ‚Äì was pointing to homepage instead of `/set-password`.  
‚Ä¢ Added debug console logging to auth state changes for troubleshooting.  
‚Ä¢ Build ID now updates automatically on every deployment, showing current commit hash.

Files: `app/login.tsx`, `app/forgot-password.tsx`, `app/_layout.tsx`, `scripts/update-build-id.js`, `package.json`.
