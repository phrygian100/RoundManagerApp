## 2025-01-02 (Final Resolution)
- **INVITATION EMAIL SYSTEM FULLY WORKING** ðŸŽ‰
  - **Phase 1**: Fixed environment variable inconsistency (SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY standardization)
  - **Phase 2**: Created missing Supabase `members` table with proper schema, indexes, and RLS policies
  - **Phase 3**: Added missing `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable to edge function secrets
  - **Phase 4**: Enhanced debugging for email sending and accept-invite flow

**Key Fixes Applied:**
1. **Database Architecture**: Created `public.members` table that edge functions expected
2. **Email Configuration**: Added proper Resend API key to Supabase function secrets
3. **Environment Variables**: Standardized all functions to use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
4. **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging to diagnose issues

**Current Status:**
- âœ… Invitation emails are being sent successfully via Resend
- âœ… 6-digit codes are being delivered to invited users
- ðŸ”§ **BUTTON ISSUE IDENTIFIED & FIXED**: React Native Button component not working in web environment
- ðŸ”„ Replaced Button with TouchableOpacity for proper web compatibility
- ðŸ”„ Added comprehensive client-side debugging to troubleshoot join flow

**Latest Fix (Button Issue):**
- **Root Cause**: React Native `Button` component doesn't trigger `onPress` in web builds
- **Solution**: Replaced with `TouchableOpacity` and custom styling for web compatibility
- **Debugging Added**: Console logs at every step of the accept-invite process

**Architecture Notes:**
- Edge functions now properly use Supabase database instead of relying solely on Firestore
- Proper Row Level Security policies ensure data security
- Comprehensive error logging for future troubleshooting

## 2025-06-30
- Fixed invite-member function:
  - Accept provided inviteCode fallback.
  - Handle `email_exists` by fetching existing user, upserting member row, and sending custom invite email via Resend.
  - Added dynamic CORS headers helper.
- Added `enter-invite-code` screen and removed invitation field from registration.

Redeployed invite-member (version 10) after patch to handle `email_exists` properly and send Resend email.

## 2025-06-30 (second patch)
- Replaced deprecated `getUserByEmail` call in invite-member Edge Function with manual lookup via `admin.listUsers` to prevent runtime TypeError.
- Manually redeployed `invite-member` function via Supabase CLI to ensure the fix went live, as Vercel builds do not automatically deploy Edge Functions.
- Added robust error handling and logging to diagnose silent failures in the Edge Function, revealing that the `listUsers` call was failing and returning an empty error object.
- Threw a new, explicit Error when `listUsers` fails to ensure proper logging.

## Handover Note: Debugging the `invite-member` Edge Function Failure

The `invite-member` function has been consistently failing with a 500 error, but the root cause has been obscured by silent failures within the logging and error handling mechanisms. The following steps have been taken to diagnose the issue:

1.  **Initial Fix:** The function originally crashed due to a call to `supabase.auth.admin.getUserByEmail`, a deprecated method. This was replaced with `admin.listUsers` and a manual filter.
2.  **Deployment Correction:** Realized that Vercel deploys do not update Supabase Edge Functions. All subsequent function updates have been deployed manually via the Supabase CLI (`npx supabase functions deploy...`).
3.  **Diagnosing Silent Errors:** After the initial fix, the function continued to fail, but the Supabase logs showed only an empty error object (`{}`). This indicated that the error being thrown by the Supabase client was not a standard JavaScript `Error` object, and attempts to log it were also failing silently.
4.  **Iterative Logging Enhancement:** Several versions of the function were deployed with increasingly robust `catch` blocks to attempt to log the non-standard error. This involved:
    *   Adding detailed `console.error` calls for different error properties.
    *   Implementing a "crash-proof" logger that logged the raw error object before attempting to stringify it in a separate `try...catch`.
    *   This process successfully confirmed that the Supabase client was throwing an empty `{}` object on failure.
5.  **Explicit Error Wrapping:** The code was modified to catch these empty `{}` errors and `throw new Error(...)` in their place. This was intended to force a proper stack trace and error message into the logs. This was applied to both the `listUsers` call (for existing emails) and the `inviteUserByEmail` call (for new emails).

**Current Status:**
Despite these measures, the function still fails and logs only an empty object. This implies the error is happening before the `try` block can even execute our new error-wrapping logic, or the error is of a nature that even our most robust logger cannot handle.

**Recommended Next Steps:**

The problem is almost certainly environmental or configuration-based at this point, rather than a logic error in the function's code.

1.  **Verify Environment Variables/Secrets:** This is the most likely culprit. The `inviteUserByEmail` call requires valid Supabase credentials.
    *   Navigate to the Supabase project dashboard: Project Settings > API.
    *   Confirm the `SUPABASE_URL` is correct.
    *   **Crucially, go to Functions > `invite-member` > Secrets and verify that `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set and its value is 100% correct and has not been rotated or revoked.** An invalid service key would explain why the admin client fails instantly.

2.  **Isolate the Failing Call:**
    *   Temporarily comment out the entire `try` block in the function.
    *   Replace it with only the `inviteUserByEmail` call, hardcoding a new test email address and a valid `accountId`.
    *   This will prove definitively if this single call is the source of the failure, removing all other variables.

3.  **Check Auth Configuration:**
    *   In the Supabase dashboard, go to Auth > Providers > Email. Ensure it is enabled.
    *   Go to Auth > URL Configuration. Ensure the `redirectTo` URL being used (`https://<your-vercel-url>/set-password`) is present in the "Redirect URLs" list. An unlisted redirect URL will cause the invite to fail.

By focusing on these external configuration and environmental factors, the true root cause of the silent failure should be revealed.
