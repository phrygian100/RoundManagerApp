## 2025-02-02 - Enhanced Activity Log Reliability with Fallback Mechanisms üîß

### Summary
Added defensive programming and fallback mechanisms to the activity log system to address potential issues where owners might not see member activity due to session setup problems. This patch improves reliability while maintaining performance and minimizing regression risk.

### Issues Addressed
- **Missing User Documents**: Members without proper `users/{uid}` documents causing session failures
- **Incorrect Account ID**: Members with wrong `accountId` in their user documents
- **Session Resolution Failures**: Cases where `getDataOwnerId()` returns null for team members
- **Poor Error Visibility**: Limited debugging information when audit logging fails

### Changes Made

**1. Added Fallback Owner ID Resolution**:
- New `fallbackGetDataOwnerId()` function that attempts to find member records when primary session resolution fails
- Uses `collectionGroup` query to find active member records across all accounts
- Falls back to treating user as owner of their own account if no member record found

**2. Enhanced Error Handling & Logging**:
- Added detailed console logging with emojis for better visibility
- Logs session state information when failures occur
- Includes action context in error messages for debugging
- Shows owner ID in successful audit log messages

**3. Defensive Programming**:
- Tries fallback mechanism only when primary `getDataOwnerId()` fails
- Maintains backward compatibility - no changes to happy path
- Graceful degradation - doesn't break main operations if audit logging fails

### Technical Implementation

**Fallback Logic Flow**:
```typescript
1. Try primary getUserSession() ‚Üí getDataOwnerId()
2. If fails: Try fallbackGetDataOwnerId(userUid)
   - Query: collectionGroup('members').where('uid', '==', userUid)
   - Extract accountId from member document path
   - Return accountId as owner ID
3. If still fails: Assume user is owner (userUid)
```

**Enhanced Logging Examples**:
```
‚úÖ Audit logged: client_created - Created client for "123 Main St" (ownerId: abc123)
‚ö†Ô∏è getDataOwnerId() returned null, attempting fallback resolution...
üîÑ Attempting fallback owner ID resolution for user: def456
‚úÖ Fallback successful: Found member record, using accountId: abc123
‚ùå Cannot log audit action: no owner ID found after all attempts
```

### Performance Characteristics
- **Happy Path**: Zero performance impact (no extra queries)
- **Fallback Path**: One additional `collectionGroup` query only when primary method fails
- **Query Efficiency**: Uses `limit(1)` and targeted `where` clauses
- **Caching**: Leverages Firestore's built-in query caching

### Risk Assessment
- ‚úÖ **Low Regression Risk**: Only adds safety nets, doesn't modify core logic
- ‚úÖ **Backward Compatible**: All existing functionality preserved
- ‚úÖ **Graceful Degradation**: Failures don't break main app operations
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Debugging**: Better visibility into audit logging issues

### Expected Outcomes
- **Improved Reliability**: Activity logs work even with incomplete session setup
- **Better Debugging**: Clear console messages help identify root causes
- **Reduced Support Issues**: Fewer "missing audit logs" problems
- **Team Visibility**: Owners more likely to see all member activities

### Files Modified
- `services/auditService.ts` - Enhanced logAction() with fallback mechanisms and better logging
- `docs/code-changes.md` - Documentation update

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Improves reliability and debugging capabilities while maintaining performance
