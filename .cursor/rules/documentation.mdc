# Project contribution rules

1. After **every** code change (function, service, component, config, etc.) you must append a concise entry to `docs/code-changes.md` describing:
   - The date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - What was changed (file / feature)
   - Why the change was made


Failure to update the changelog blocks the PR / commit review.
